# Mariner: Explore the Hi-Cs

\`mariner\` is an R/Bioconductor package for exploring Hi-C data. It
enables users to flexibly manipulate, extract, and aggregate chromatin
interaction data quickly and efficiently.

## Details

Key Features:

- Manipulating Paired Ranges - Convert, bin, and shift paired genomic
  ranges.

- Clustering & Merging Interactions - Group nearby interactions and
  select one as representative.

- Extracting & Aggregating Interactions - Pull Hi-C pixels or matrices,
  then aggregate by files or interactions.

- Calculating Loop Enrichment - Determine loop enrichment to local
  background with selection functions to flexibility select foreground
  and background.
